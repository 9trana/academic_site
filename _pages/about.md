My name is Alex Tran, a researcher from Ontario, Canada. I am a trained social psychologist that has crossed a number of disciplines, from EEG signal processing, to coding (MATLAB, R, SQL), to insights in epidemiology, to post-secondary education teaching, and some experience with entrepreneurship. Using my data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization and storytelling skills, I aim to turn complex data into meaningful insights. I thrive in a fast-paced environment and rise to challenges, including those outside of my area of expertise. I can quickly get acquainted to new projects and teams, coding and programming languages, and subject matter in diverse fields. I enjoy working with people, educating them on the techniques I employ and utilizing abstract data to inform decision-making in real world applications.
