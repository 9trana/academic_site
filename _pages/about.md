My name is Alexander Tran, a social scientist, researcher, and data-specialist from Ontario, Canada. I am a trained social psychologist (PhD) with extensive experience conducting experiments (A/B testing) based on theories of human behaviour during my graduate studies. Since then, my knowledge and statistical modelling skills have crossed a number of disciplines, with expertise in EEG signal processing, coding (MATLAB, R, Python, SQL), and population-level research (epidemiology). Professionally, I worked as a data scientist at CAMH, taught at the post-secondary level and dabbled in entrepreneurship as a Behavioural Research Consultant. 

I apply my data cleaning/analysis, statistical modelling, data visualization and storytelling skills to any problem with curiousity and an attention-to-detail. I thrive in a fast-paced environment and rise to any challenge. I enjoy working with people, educating them on the techniques I employ and utilizing abstract data to inform decision-making in real world applications.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
