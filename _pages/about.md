My name is Alexander Tran, a social scientist, researcher, and data-specialist from Ontario, Canada. I am a trained social psychologist (PhD) with extensive experience conducting experiments based on theories of human behaviour during my graduate studies. Since then, my knowledge and statistical modelling skills have crossed a number of disciplines, with expertise in EEG signal processing, coding (MATLAB, R, SQL), and population-level research (epidemiology). Professionally, I have acquired experience in post-secondary education teaching and dabbled in entrepreneurship as a Behavioural Research Consultant. I apply my data cleaning/analysis, statistical modelling, data visualization and storytelling skills to any problem, and to turn complex trends into meaningful insights. I thrive in a fast-paced environment and rise to challenges, including those outside of my area of expertise. I can quickly get acquainted to new projects and teams, coding and programming languages, and subject matter in diverse fields. I enjoy working with people, educating them on the techniques I employ and utilizing abstract data to inform decision-making in real world applications.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
