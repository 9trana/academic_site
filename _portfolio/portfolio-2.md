# MATLAB code that runs an in-lab experiment (Stroop Task) and records participant response data<br/>


# SQL query that pulls publicly available data, filters for outliers based on response time, and joins with another table based on ID<br/>


# SPSS syntax that renames multiple variables and runs moderated linear regression for multiple outcome variables<br/>
